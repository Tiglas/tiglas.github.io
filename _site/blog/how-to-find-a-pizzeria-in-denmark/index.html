      <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Last week I visited Copenhagen some good friends of mine. It was one of those things that I didn’t really take time to think about, but rather decided to go on the spur of the moment. A perfect way to spend a weekend as it turned out.
My first taste of Danish food was in the form brunch for which we had to brave the elements to get to. As I soon discovered, the food was great and the buffet offered a healthy variety. Having had our fill, we began exploring the city like good old tourists do, with the exception that we were accompanied by our two Danish friends. The city art museum quite stood out for me: the art on display magnificently explored human history and culture. We found time to visit the Little Mermaid and I have to admit it produced little excitement in me, perhaps due to my lack of acquintance with the works of $AUTHOR. As the day wore on, we decided to have dinner at a nearby pizzeria, the subject of this story. And so began an evening of pizza, good conversation and laughter. It was also one of my friend’s birthday too. After dinner, jetlag began our lack of sleep began to show and we were simply too tired to go out (the best laid plans of men and mice). 
The hostel I stayed in wasn’t exactly heavenly, but it was fine. I got a little shock though as one of the guys sharing the room burst in and asked in very colorful language “whoever took his wallet to return, just the wallet, ‘cos he didn’t need the money” as he couldn’t go home as a result. No one answered, except for a few sleepy stares. I set out the following day to find the pizzeria we had been to the previous day. So I took the map only to realize that
I couldn’t remember the name (I usually go straight for the pizza and skip the pizzeria names). I asked the friends who were with me, but none could remember the name despite being vaguely aware of the location within the City. But then I really needed to go back to that pizzeria. So with a map, I set out to retrace our steps from last night. However, I remembered that we took bus 3A and one of our other friends took bus 5A at the same bus stop. And then boom!
it hit me that I could actually trace my way by looking for the location on the map where bus 3A and 5A shared a road segment. I hopped onto bus 350S and asked the burly driver where I should drop off, but his reply was dismissively “I can’t help you young man, use your phone” while laughing. Having listened to my ordeal, an old man in the same bus came and asked where I wanted go. He was old, his steps considered and his vision far from perfect. But he asked me to tell him the name of the street I wanted to go to. $STREETNAME I said. Granted, my Danish isn’t great, but after several repititions he was able to get where I wanted to go. And so he gave me small tour of the city as we rode the bus, pointing out historical artefacts and tourist attractions all the while promising that he will show me where to alight. And show me did, even going further to point at with his fingers while smiling. The gesture was so touching.
It took me a short while to locate the place. And then I explained to the waiter why I was there. And ordered another pizza. Which was good. The city of Copenhagen has a lot more to offer than merely pizza.
The people actually talk in buses, offer to help and share seats in buses. less earphones/headphones too. Beautiful Copenhagen</p>
