Since the turn of the year, I have been working on my thesis project at Ericsson. The project involves building a pickup
planner system that can be used by Fleet Management companies to provide transportation services to smart city dwellers.
The project has been a very interesting and challenging undertaking. Working with industry stakeholders has afforded me the opportunity to learn lots of stuff along the way. I intend to do a technical deep dive into the project on completion: the implementation was done using Answer Set Programming and clustering techniques. 

A prototype implementation of the sytem is in the demo videos below:
