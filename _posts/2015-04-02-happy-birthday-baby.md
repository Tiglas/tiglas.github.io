title: Happy Cake Day!
---

This is the first post on this website and time has so willed that today is my baby's birthday.
I wanted to take a moment to say how much of a blessing you have been to me. Looking back, not 
even in my wildest imaginations would I have exptected a chance meeting in a petrol station to
turn out quite like it has. See, I had to turn back and follow you after you had passed me, while
pretending to be headed in the same direction as you were. Thankfully, the noise coming from the nearby
garage ensured that my increased heartbeats did not expose my nervousness...or at least that's what I 
assumed. In the end, it was well worth it.

Thank you for all the moments we have shared - I've learnt a lot from you and I can unequivocally 
say that you've made me a better man. You are an amazing person, and while circumstances have seen to it
that for the second time, we don't get to celebrate the birthday together, I'd like wish you many happy 
days ahead, full of smiles and laughter. And Sunday love.

Happy Birthday Sheri!
