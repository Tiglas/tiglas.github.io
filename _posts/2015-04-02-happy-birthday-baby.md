title: Happy Cake Day!
---

This is the first post on my website and today is my baby's birthday.
I wanted to take a moment to say how much of a blessing you have been to me.
You are an amazing person, and while circumstances have ensured that for the 
second time running we don't get to celebrate your birthday together, I'd like
wish you many happy days ahead, full of smiles and laughter. 
Happy Birthday!
