This past week on 2nd April, 147 students at Garissa University
had their lives and dreams cut short by terrorists' guns. These students represented 
the hopes and aspirations of
their families (and sometimes whole communities). For the innocent victims of this
most inhuman attack, their lives is the heavy price our nation had to pay in failing to provide  adequate
security to its citizens. They were our sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, cousins, uncles, relatives and friends. 
They're not just 147 people: they've got names and we honour their memory <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23147notjustanumber&src=tyah" target="_blank">#147notjustanumber</a>.
