Winter is gone, spring is finally here! The weather is good, the sun 
lifting the gloom off most people's faces. Seeing snow for the fist time
was definitely exciting, but spring weather is way more benign. Here are 
some pictures I've taken over the course of last autumn:

1. <em>Uppsala cathedral</em>: tall, imposing buiding with great architecture. Visible from most parts of
the city.

<br/>
2. <em>Flustret</em>: one of the first places our guide took us to. As he pointed out, flustret 
literally translates to "mouth of the beehive".

<br/>
3. <em>Wild ducks</em>: one never fails to notice the ducks in the pond next to Flustret. They disappear during winter and reappear around spring.

4. <em>Fyris river</em> flows right through the city centre.

5. __Välkommen till Eklundshof__  
Swedish isn't very hard to pick up, right?
