**home** 

*noun* \ˈhōm\  
:a place of love and comfort that always welcomes you with open arms - and perhaps a plate of freshly baked
cookies - Jaime Meier

This past August I had the pleasure of travelling back home after nearly a year away. The summary of my experience away
from home thus far, if you may, would be that nothing really comes close to home. But then again that says nothing about missing the
people I love and care about and life without *Ugali* and fish. I digress though: my visit home culminated in the most amazing, nay ethereal 
August a year has ever given me. 

I had occasion to visit my siblings in Rusinga Island where I was met with a lot of interesting new developments. The
first tarmacked road in the entire town had just been completed, transforming the usually topsy-turvy 2 hour journey from Homa Bay
to Mbita into a rather pleasant half an hour ride. Perhaps more indicative of the strides being made in the county,
construction of a bridge spanning the course-way joining the island and Mbita town was underway. Long overdue, some
will dismissively suggest. However, I posit that while a lot more could be done, this is a sign of what we are capable of doing to foster economic progress and deserves applause.
