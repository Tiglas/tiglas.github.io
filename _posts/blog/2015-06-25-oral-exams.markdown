This past spring was perhaps one of the busiest periods of my studies so far: quite a bit of advanced coursework and projects. Additionally, I
had the novel experience of taking oral examinations for the first time in my student life. 
The oral examinations were typically short (~20 minutes), but very intense in the sense that each question
led onto the next and even the slightest hint of hesitation invited more questions along the same lines. In the
end, I found them quite engaging and interesting - I even had occasion to be asked by one of the teachers what I wanted to be
examined on. Suffice to say that I invariably chose the area I felt I was best prepared for, but the suggestion in itself was incredible to me. But that's Sweden for you - the teachers and students cooperate to foster learning. The societal structure is flat and the relationship
between teachers (they aren't even referred to by their doctorate titles) and students is very informal. 

I found out that I enjoy oral examinations for the same reasons I enjoy oral interviews: they present an opportunity to
persuade while giving immediate feedback.
