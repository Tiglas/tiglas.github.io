Looking back on my visit back home last August, I have learnt to appreciate the little things we often take for granted.
Family, friends, experiences, name them. It was especially humbling when my sister invariably asked what food I had missed most so she would prepare it for me. Now, by my recollection, she always cooked chapati on Christmas. Hers are simply the best chapatis I have
ever had the pleasure of eating. And so she made me some: I savored the taste of love in every one of them. This is one of the things that I will
always remember. She gave me the gift of an early Christmas.
