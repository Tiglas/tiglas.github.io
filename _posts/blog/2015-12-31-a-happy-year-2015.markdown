The past year has been an amazing journey for me, most of which I have spent in a foreign country. This invariably comes with it's own
challenges, but the opportunities it has presented have been immense too. My initial trepidation about leaving family, friends and
a not-too-shabby job to pursue
further studies has mostly been displaced by a sense that it has all been worth it. I have had the chance to meet people
from different parts of the world, make new friends, travel quite a bit (I should do more of this) and form networks
that hopefully will outlast my stay in Sweden.

And so to godsent friends like Dicle, who've made my stay interesting and thankfully offered a sneak peek into the bright future...a wholehearted thank you. 

To baby - *kwendete mono*. And to 2016,
more of the same!
