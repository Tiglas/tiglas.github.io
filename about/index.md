</> Programming skills

* Python 
* Java
* Android
* C/C++
* SQL
* Bash scripting

What do I do in my free time?

* I am curious about new technologies. I am currently picking up Android programming by building apps as a side project. 
* Languages intrigue me a lot - I'm learning [survival] Swedish. 
* I am a member of <a href="http://www.v-dala.se/association/samba-sao-miguel/"> Samba SÃ£o Miguel</a> where I get to practise my
rather awkward dance moves.
* Traveling affords me the opportunity to discover new places and experiences.
