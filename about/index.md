</> Programming skills

* Fluent in Python and Java
* I also have some exposure to C/C++
* Bash scripting

What do I do in my free time?

* Personal projects, the latest being a toy web crawler implementation in Java. GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Tiglas"> tiglas </a>. 
* Languages intrigue me a lot - I'm currently learning [survival] Swedish. 
* I am a member of <a href="http://www.v-dala.se/association/samba-sao-miguel/"> Samba SÃ£o Miguel</a> where I get to practise my
rather awkward dance moves.
* Traveling affords me the opportunity to discover new places and experiences.
