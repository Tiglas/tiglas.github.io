<!-- ![me]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nick2.png) -->

I am a Masters student in the Department of Information Technology  at Uppsala university. My areas of interest are computer networks, pervasive computing and telecommunications. I'm a big fan of Python, but often work/play with Erlang and C.

What do I do in my free time?

* Languages intrigue me a lot - I'm currently learning [survival] Swedish. 
* I am a member of [Samba SÃ£o Miguel](http://www.v-dala.se/association/samba-sao-miguel/) where I get to practise my
rather awkward dance moves.
* Traveling affords me the opportunity to discover new places and experiences.
