Some projects I've been involved with:

* Programming Embedded Systems: built a Raspberry Pi robot car remotely controlled through an Android phone application. Demo <a href="https://youtu.be/63emuzbKwHk"> video </a>.
* Harvesting energy from bikes: investigated and demonstrated the feasibility of harvesting ambient energy from bicycles in Uppsala city. Sufficient energy was generated to power an Arduino and a bluetooth node.
* Computer Networks: undertook research and presented a paper on "DDoS Detection and Prevention".
